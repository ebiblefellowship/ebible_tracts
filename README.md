# EBible Fellowship Tracts

This repository contains tract source files used as the basis for formatting into web pages and PDF's as well as being the basis for translations to other languages.

This repository is linked with an account on (webtranslateit.com), a web based translation management application.  It will pick up changes to the source files and post back updates to translations when they are made.

Files are named with a suffix before the file extension that has the 
[ISO-639 two letter lanugage code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes), 
e.g. `spiritual-judgment.en.yml` where "en" is the code for English.  As English (en) is configured as the source language in WebTranslateIT, it will save the translated files with the same naming pattern but substituting the appropriate lanugage code for the respective translation, e.g. "es" for Spanish or "zh" for Chinese. For more information, see the [WebTranslateIT Locale Help](https://webtranslateit.com/en/docs/locale/).
